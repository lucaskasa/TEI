## TANGIBLE AND EMBODIED INTERACTION
### Welcome
#### This project researches how augmented reality could be used for anatomy teaching. We utilized a combination of existing augmented reality software with support for handheld devices. We created prototypes of simple anatomy models for the physical counterpart of the virtual models. The models were equipped with simple sensors for determining the state of the model, for instance picking apart the chest cavity in order to render the visuals accordingly. The wizard of oz technique was used as well for simulating interaction with the artifact that is not possible to prototype within the given timeframe.
